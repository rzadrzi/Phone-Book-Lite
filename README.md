# Phone Book Lite
this is **CRUD** project and I don't use any technology!
I only used **window.localStorage** as Database.

You can :
- Create (name, phone number) -> name is `Primarykey`
- Read all names and phone numbers in a `table`
- Delete in `table` any row have `Delete button` press and delete the record :wink:
