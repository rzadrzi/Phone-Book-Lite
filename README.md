# Phone Book Lite
this is **CRUD** project and I don't use any technology!<br>
I only used **window.localStorage** as a Database.

You can :
- Create (name, phone number) -> name is `Primarykey`
- Read all names and phone numbers in a `table`
- Delete in `table` any row have `Delete button` press and delete the record :wink:
- Edit in `table` any row have `Edit button` press and edit the record for edit I use `Create Form` 
- Search I make a search form and you can search by name sadly only name :expressionless:
